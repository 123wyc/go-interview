### Description

Implement a Stack. A stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements, with two principal operations: push, which adds an element to the collection, and pop, which removes the most recently added element that was not yet removed

### Example:

```
Input: values = "value1", "value1", "value2" 
Output: ["value1", "value2"]
```
