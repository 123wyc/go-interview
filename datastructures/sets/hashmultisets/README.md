### Description

Implement a Multi Set. Like a set, it allows for efficient storage and retrieval of items without a guaranteed order.

However, unlike a set, it allows for multiple occurrences of the same element by tracking the count of each unique element it contains.

### Example:

```
Input: Push "value1", Push "value2", Push "value3", Pop 
Output: ["value2", "value1"]
```
